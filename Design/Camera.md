# Camera 📸

## Idea 1

Fully stationary camera. The full scene is always in view and there are so zooms or anything.

#### Pros:

- Easy to implement
- Easy to follow, simple

#### Cons:

- A bit boooooring

## Idea 2

Mostly stationary camera. Would zoom in on the fish getting caught on the hook. Camera could follow the fish when it's getting pulled out of water.

#### Pros:

- Dynamic

#### Cons:

- Not so easy to implement
- Motion sickness
- More things could go wrong

## Decision

Idea 1, takes less time and easier to implement.🦵
We could consider the dynamic camera if we have time.
